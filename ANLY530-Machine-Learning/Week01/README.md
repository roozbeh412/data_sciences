## Learning Path

### Step 1: Theory
1. Review the lecture slides (`ANLY530Lecture01_IntrotoML.pptx`)
2. Read Chapter 1 in the Geron textbook
3. Understand the taxonomy of machine learning

### Step 2: Practice
1. Work through the tutorial (`01_Intro_to_Machine_Learning.html`)
2. Follow along with the code chunks, observing how math translates to code
3. Understand the conceptual differences shown in the visualizations

### Step 3: Apply
1. Experiment with tweaking the code in the `.rmd` file locally (e.g. changing cluster numbers or noise levels)
2. Verify you can compile the `.rmd` file to HTML on your own machine

## Key Concepts

### Machine Learning Taxonomy
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data (e.g., Classification, Regression). Goal is to predict.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Learning with unlabeled data (e.g., Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction). Goal is to discover structure.

### Linear Algebra
- **Vectors**: Ordered lists of numbers representing points in space or feature sets.
- **Matrices**: 2D arrays representing datasets (rows = instances, columns = features) or transformations.
- **Eigenvectors**: Vectors whose direction is not changed by a linear transformation; crucial for techniques like PCA.
