## Course Content

This week covers:

### Lecture Topics
- What is SVM? Classification by finding the widest road
- Hyperplanes, margins, and support vectors
- Why maximum-margin classification generalises well
- Linear optimisation and the SVM objective function

### Hands-on Tutorial Topics
- The big idea: finding the widest road between classes
- Key terminology in plain English (hyperplane, margin, support vectors, C, kernel)
- Linear SVM: the math behind the road
  - Hard-margin vs. soft-margin classification
  - The C parameter as a strictness dial (with 4-panel visualisation)
- The kernel trick: drawing curved boundaries
  - 1D → 2D lifting intuition
  - Comparing linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels
- RBF kernel deep dive: gamma parameter effects and C × gamma interaction grid
- Building SVMs in R with `e1071`
  - Iris classification and decision boundary
  - Hyperparameter tuning with `tune()` and cross-validation
- Feature scaling: why it's critical for SVM
- Support Vector Regression (SVR) and the epsilon-insensitive tube
- Model comparison: Decision Tree vs. Random Forest vs. Linear SVM vs. RBF SVM
- Multi-class SVM (One-vs-One strategy)
- Advantages, disadvantages, and practical tips

## Learning Path

### Step 1: Theory
1. Review the lecture slides (`Lecture06-SVM.pptx`)
2. Read Chapter 5 in the Géron textbook
3. Understand the intuition: maximum-margin classification, support vectors, and the kernel trick

### Step 2: Practice
1. Work through the tutorial (`Week05-SVM-Tutorial.html`)
2. Follow along with the code chunks — observe how the margin, C, gamma, and kernels change the boundary
3. Compare SVM decision boundaries with Decision Tree and Random Forest from previous weeks

### Step 3: Apply
1. Experiment with different C and gamma values on your own datasets
2. Try the polynomial kernel with different degrees
3. Apply SVR to a regression problem of your choice
4. Verify you can compile the `.Rmd` file to HTML on your own machine

## Key Concepts

### Support Vector Machines
- **Hyperplane**: The decision boundary that separates classes
- **Margin**: The gap between the closest points of each class; SVM maximises this
- **Support Vectors**: The critical few data points that define the boundary
- **C Parameter**: Trade-off between a wide margin (simple model) and correct classification (complex model)
- **Kernel Trick**: Transform data into higher dimensions so a linear separator works for non-linear data
- **RBF Kernel**: The most popular non-linear kernel; gamma controls each point's influence radius
- **Feature Scaling**: Always required for SVM — standardise features to zero mean and unit variance
- **SVR**: SVM for regression using an epsilon-insensitive tube
